## Features

- **Interactive Canvas Spotlight** — a smooth, glowing cursor trail built with the HTML5 Canvas API. The trail reveals a top image over a background image using compositing techniques.
- **Framer Motion Animations** — staggered entrance animations for the navbar, headings, description text, and CTA button.
- **Cinematic Typography** — Google Fonts including *Bebas Neue*, *Cinzel*, and *Cormorant Garamond* for a dark, editorial feel.
- **Gotham-themed Navbar** — fixed, glassmorphism-style navbar with gold hover underline effects.
- **Dark aesthetic** — deep blacks, crimson reds, and gold accents throughout.

## How the Spotlight Effect Works

1. Two images are loaded — a background (`twoo.jpg`) and a reveal image (`1199261.jpg`).
2. On every animation frame, the canvas draws the background image first.
3. An offscreen canvas renders a trail of circles following the smoothed cursor position, each fading out toward the tail.
4. Using `source-in` compositing, the reveal image is masked to only show through those circles.
5. The masked result is drawn on top of the background.
6. A radial golden glow is painted at the cursor head for a bat-signal effect.
